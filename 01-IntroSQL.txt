Database Management Systems (DBMS)
------------------------------------------------------
A special software program that helps users create and maintain a database
	Makes it easy to manage large amounts of information
	Handles Security
	Backups
	Importing/exporting data
	Concurrency
	Interacts with software applications 

======================================================================
Two Types of Databases
-------------------------------
Relational Databases (SQV)									Non-Relational (noSQL / not just SQL)
	Organize data into one or more tables					Organize data is anything but a traditional table
		Each table has columns and rows						Key-value stores
		A unique key identifies each row						Documents (JSON, XML, etc)
																						Graphs
																						Flexible Tables

==============================================================================
Structured Query Language (SQL)
--------------------------------------------
* SQL is a language used for interacting with Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
	You can use SQL to get the RDBMS to do things for you
	Create, retrieve, update & delete data
	Create & manage databases
	Design & create database tables
	Perform administration tasks (security, user management, import/export, etc)
* SQL implementations vary between systems
	Not all RDBMS' follow the SQL standard to a 'T'
	The concepts are the same but the implementation may vary

Structured Query Language (SQL)
• SQL is actually a hybrid language, it's basically 4 types of languages in one
Data Query Language (DQL)
	• Used to query the database for information.
	• Get information that is already stored there
Data Definition Language (DDL)
	• Used for defining database schemas.
Data Control Language (DCL)
	• Used for controlling access to the data in the database.
	• User & permissions management
Data Manipulation Language (DML)
	• Used for inserting, updating and deleting data from the database
=======================================================================================
Some of The Most Important SQL Commands:
-----------------------------------------------------------
* SELECT - extracts data from a database
* UPDATE - updates data in a database
* DELETE - deletes data from a database
* INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
* CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
* ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
* CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
* ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
* DROP TABLE - deletes a table
* CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
* DROP INDEX - deletes an index

SELECT Statement
-------------------------
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.
